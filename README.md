# SQL Query Practice

In this exercise we'll practice writing SQL queries. Please use the `Wedge.DB` database. 
My recommendation is that you write your code in a plain text editor. Your OS comes with
one, but it's often nice to have a "fancier" one. Some recommendations: 

* [Ultraedit](https://www.ultraedit.com/)
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
* [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

I've included a .SQL file in the repository for you to work in, but there's nothing special
about it. You could make one yourself by just making a plain text file and changing the file
extension. 

The typical flow for working on SQL could be something like this: 

1. Write the basic query in your DB Browser. 
1. Copy this over into your text file so you have a persistent copy.
1. Refine the query in the DB Browser. 
1. When you're done, copy over the finished product to your .sql file and save it.
